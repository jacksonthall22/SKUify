# SKUify

### Description
This simple script takes an Amazon product title as an input string, makes it lowercase, removes 
any non-alphanumeric characters, cuts off all full words past 40 characters, and converts spaces 
between the remaining words to dashes. The result is printed to the screen and copied to the clipboard
using the Pyperclip module, which can be installed with `pip install pyperclip` or downloaded
[here](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/).
